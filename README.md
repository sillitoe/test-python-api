# Python API Test

## Aim: 

Investigate Python-based frameworks that can do the following:

 * generate a "Hello, World" API
 * produce a valid OpenAPI specification

### Django REST Framework

Looks like a mature, well used framework. OpenAPI compatibility doesn't yet look completely settled (3rd party plugins)

* [openapi](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/documenting-your-api/)

### APIStar

Newer project - apparently lots of overlap with DRF. Looks good - generates nice API docs - very little internal docs though. Probably too early to use.
