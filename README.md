# Python API Frameworks

Aim - from the perspective of a novice Python user (but competent web/API programmer) - investigate Python-based frameworks that can do the following:

* generate a "Hello, World" API (or equivalent)
* produce a valid OpenAPI specification

### Django REST Framework

**First impressions?**

Mature, well used. OpenAPI compatibility isn't available via core, but seems to be available via 3rd party plugins.

* [quickstart](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/)
* [api docs](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/documenting-your-api/) - available plugins
* [drf_yasg](https://drf-yasg.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - produced v2.0 docs with zero hassle

### APIStar

**First impressions?**

Pretty new and shiny. Apparently lots of overlap with DRF. Seems like it has lots of nice features, but code is still mobile and internal docs are scarce. The synopsis for generating API docs is very simple but it works and is nice. Probably too early to use.
